        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Ryan and welcome to my website! I'm currently studying Computer Science at CSUF with a concentration in Cybersecurity. Through projects like building a Home SOC Lab, setting up an Active Directory environment, and running vulnerability management testing, I've gained hands-on experience with tools such as Oracle VirtualBox, PowerShell, Azure Services, KQL, VMware, and Nessus Essentials. Alongside my studies, I've always valued teamwork and perseverance which are qualities I built over 11 years of playing baseball. The lessons I learned on the field about discipline, communication, and working toward a common goal carry over into my approach to solving technical challenges and collaborating with others in the world of technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            My interests include helping others with technical issues, keeping users safe and secure, and exploring new technologies. Outside of tech, I enjoy staying active at the gym, surfing, and playing men's softball with friends. I also like cooking, watching movies, and reading.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect.
